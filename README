A very simple wireless packet sniffer.  I wrote it as a code sample for a job talk.  At the time, I was playing with Onavo, an iPhone app that compresses data on your iPhone to minimize data plan usage.  I was quite shocked that my iPhone was beaconing the SSID 'onavo-disabled.'  As a result, I removed the app.  Pretty creepy that an app can cause your iPhone to beacon.

Requirements:
	LibPCAP - Version 1.3.0-1
	Boost - Version 1.49.0.1
	wireless card capable of sniffing in monitor mode
	optional Valgrind for memory leaks


To Run:
  make monitor WLAN_IF=<wlan_iface>
  make run


Sample Output:
rix@rix-EX58-UD5:~/Desktop/cpp_sample$ make monitor
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
rix@rix-EX58-UD5:~/Desktop/cpp_sample$ make run
sudo ./wlanSniff wlan0
wlan0
